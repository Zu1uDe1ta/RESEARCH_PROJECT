# Data Visualization

As this part of the lab, you need to pick one these data viz packages, and then

- show some snazzy examples of what a DE can do with this package
  - this can be examples from tutorials or other examples
  - they need to be "wow" - you may want to find a "Gallery" of cool examples
- show how you would "drive" this package with a language, preferably Python (or another DE language, perhaps the language you chose for the language portion of this lab.)
  - write 3 or 4 sample programs that use the language to create a visualization from some simple, understandable data
- write a jupyter notebook (in python or other language) which acts as a "walk-thru" teaching someone how do the fundamentals of your chosen package

You choices are:

- Bokeh 
- ggplot or ggplot2
- matplotlib
- Plotly
- Seaborn

(all of these really cool)
