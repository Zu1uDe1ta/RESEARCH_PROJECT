# STACKOVERFLOW 

### Context

- Stack Overflow is the largest online community for programmers to learn, share their knowledge, and advance their careers.

### Inspiration



What is the percentage of questions that have been answered over the years?

What is the reputation and badge count of users across different tenures on StackOverflow?

What are 10 of the “easier” gold badges to earn?

Which day of the week has most questions answered within an hour?


### Content

- Updated on a quarterly basis, this BigQuery dataset includes an archive of Stack Overflow content, including posts, votes, tags, and badges. 
- This dataset is updated to mirror the Stack Overflow content on the Internet Archive, and is also available through the Stack Exchange Data Explorer.

# JULIA 

## WHY JULIA?

- Julia is relatively new high-level free/open-source language for numerical computing in the same spirit, with a rich set of built-in types and libraries for working with linear algebra and other types of computations, with a syntax that is superficially reminiscent of Matlab's. 
- Basically, we are using Julia because, unlike Matlab or Python or R, it scales better to real computational problems — you can write performance-critical "inner loops" in Julia, whereas similar tasks in other high-level languages often require one to drop down to C or similar low-level languages.
- Julia is a high-level dynamic programming language designed to address the needs of high-performance numerical analysis, and scientific computing is rapidly gaining popularity amongst the data scientists. 
- It is a newer language, also capable of general purpose programming as well and hasn’t been around as long as R or Python.
- Due to its faster execution, Julia has become a perfect choice for dealing with complex projects containing high volume data sets. For many basic benchmarks run 30 times quicker than Python and regularly run somewhat quicker than C code. 
- If you like Python’s syntax while you have a massive amount of data, then Julia is the next programming language to learn.
- A joint effort between Jupyter and Julia communities, it gives a fantastic program based graphical notebook interface to Julia. People, who are searching for the best performance parallel computing language focused on numerical computing, Julia is a perfect language for them.


## UTILIZING JULIA 
- We thank you for being a Julia user. Julia Computing has decided to sunset JuliaBox on May 31, 2020. If you are a paid JuliaBox user, you will no longer be able to log in and you will not be charged for JuliaBox after that date. 
- An alternative is to download the JuliaPro package, which includes Julia, IJulia, the Juno IDE based on the Atom editor, and a number of packages pre-installed.


## ECOSYSTEM 

### Plotting
There are several plotting packages available for Julia. 
If you followed the installation instructions, above, you already have one full-featured Matlab-like plotting package installed: PyPlot, which is simply a wrapper around Python's amazing Matplotlib library.

# CASSANDRA

In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete[1] (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage.[2] Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic functions of CRUD, such as retrieve instead of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete. CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information; often using computer-based forms and reports.
